A Symptom of a Social Problem.

In the weeks leading up to New Years Eve and the
night itself, there already 50 car fires in Utrecht. If
you add the additional 90 car fires happening in
other months, you get an astonishing 140 cars.

The municipality is under pressure from the media
to solve this issue quickly, and the mayor is frequently
asked about it. A taskforce was established
consisting of people from the police, the municipality,
department security, youth workers from
JOU, the OM, and the VRU.

The police reports showed that the perpetrators are aged between 13 â€“ 20 years old.
This is relatively low compared to other crimes. Apparently, the bar to light cars on
fires is low enough for these youngsters. Because it is very easy, and the chances of
getting caught are very low.

The issue of vandalistic car fires is extremely complex, with deep sociological
roots that make it difficult to address. Although complex social problems can only
be solved over a longer period of time, the severity of the symptoms pressure the
authorities to such extent, that they want to find a solution now. The choice to
focus on developing an understanding of these sociological roots of the problem
made coming up with a short-term solution nearly impossible.

With all this content the persona Omar was created, showing the life of a third
culture kid in one the neighborhoods. The culture in which his roots are, strongly
influence his life. On the street and at school, there is a different culture in
which he does not fit into. This results in feeling like an outsider in the Dutch
culture but also in his own. We have created this tool to assist readers in seeing
the bigger picture around vandalistic car fires which will support them in
developing clear, focused solutions.
