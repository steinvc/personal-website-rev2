This project had a very clear briefing: design a
salad shaker for promotion of Bonduelle corn
products in Ahold Delhaize supermarkets.
The very limited price was one of the biggest
challenges during this project. This meant a lot of
optimization was needed to get the functionality
to the desired level.

> **What is a salad shaker?**<br>
> A salad shaker is a container for keeping your salad fresh. It has a separate compartment for dressing and croutons so your salad won't get soggy. When you are going to eat your salad, you can add the dressing and croutons and "shake" all of the ingredients to incorporate them.


## Process

## FOT

First Out of Tool. This is the first sample out of the injection mold.

For me this was the first time I got to manage a project from sketch to final product. I learned a lot about how great of a responsibility you have as a designer when making decisions in such a design process, and how that affects the final outcome.
