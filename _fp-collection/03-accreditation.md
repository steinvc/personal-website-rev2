In 2018 I was asked to help with generating material for the accreditation of the Industrial Product Design program, to give the committee a fair image of how students feel about the program.

## Documentary

This is a short documentary about Industrial Product Design at the HAN in which students give their opinions about various topics.

The video was part of the material that was send to the accreditation committee for review, before the hearing took place. Because the documentary was also used as a feedback tool for improving the curriculum, I made editing decisions that kept it quite comprehensive. Most important for me was that the student's voices were heard, without any filters.

## Infographic Posters

I designed two infographics. One displaying the newly developed curriculum and the other visualizing the graduation process. As the infographics concern an industrial design program, I chose to graphically emphasize this by making the posters look functional and robust. I used simple geometric shapes and color to communicate the information in a plain and clear manner.
