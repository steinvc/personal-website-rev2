This is the result of a 3 day 'pressure cooker' assignment from [Co-Design Studio](http://codesignstudio.strikingly.com/) during International Week. We went on a trip to Turku (in Finland) to help HUB Turku, a downtown co-working & makerspace, with their idea for a material library.

This video explains our concept:
