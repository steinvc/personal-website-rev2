In my free time I love to produce electronic music. And as a designer I'm fascinated by all the gear and devices you can use to control or influence sound on the computer (keyboards, launchpads, etc). I set out to create my own device. I build it on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and it uses the [MIDI protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) to communicate with the computer (using [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/)). You can see it in action here:

## Design Process

I've had the electronics for this project laying around for quite some time. While enrolled in the Co-Design program I got some time to put everything together during "Week of the Bedside Table". A 3-day project wherein you could work on your own personal project. I used it to give this MIDI Controller a proper housing.

The housing is made out of beechwood. It is closed with magnets so you can always open it later to fix, replace or change parts.

The plexiglass panels can also be switched for different ones. This way it's easy to expand on the features by adding ports to the I/O or new buttons.
